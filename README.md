# Demo for Brickbat Game



**This is for EE551 project in Spring2019**


## Introduction:
    This game will major show some basics function for Brickbat Game and the user can control and play the game
             
             
## Packages for this game:
    Major use "pygame" package to achieve and "system" "time" "random" packages will also need to be imported
             
            
## What I will do for the game:
             1. Achieve one ball will move on the screen
             2. The ball can bounce back when it touch the boundary
             3. Draw the back plate and make it move
             4. Game flow and control logic
             5. Draw text to show game information
     
 
## Game Logic:
             1. When the ball bounce at bricks they will disappear
             2. When the back plate cannot catch the ball the screen wil8l show "Game Over"
             3. When all bricks disappear with the hit from the ball the screen wil show "You Win The Game"
             
             
## Plan:
             ~Week4 : Proposal of my project
             
             Week5 ~ Week6 : Seperate the whole coding work into many pieces : Draw welcome page and Final page as "You Win the Game"
             or "Game Over"
                             Draw the bricks and ball and the back plate
                             
             Week7 ~ Week8 :  Codes about how to make the ball and the back plate move and ball need to bounce when it touch bricks 
             andboundary or the back plate
             
             Week9 ~ Week12 : Codes for logistic with the game as when the ball bounce at bricks, bricks will disappear and the screen wil
             show "You Win the Game" when you break all bricks or "Game Over" when the back plate cannot get the ball when the ball bounce
             back
             
             Week13 :Improve and refine the total project
             Week14 :Final check with the project
